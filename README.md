# Logical

The open source digital logic gate simulator.

Logical is currently hosted on Replit at [https://logical.ckyiu.repl.co/](https://logical.ckyiu.repl.co/). Please note that this repository holds raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and therefore the site is beta. There is a [rewrite](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/LogicalSimulator) in progress that will use this code.

Logical does not currently work on mobile devices. (the rewrite aims to fix that too!)
