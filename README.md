# Logical

> Please note that **this is the code for the old simulator**! There is a rewrite in progress, with better mobile support, snapshotting, faster loading times, and more! **Check it out at [https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/LogicalSimulator](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/LogicalSimulator).**

The open source digital logic gate simulator.

Logical is currently hosted on Replit at [https://logical.ckyiu.repl.co/](https://logical.ckyiu.repl.co/). Please note that this repository holds raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and therefore the site is beta. There is a [rewrite](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/LogicalSimulator) in progress that will use this code.

Logical does not currently work on mobile devices. (the rewrite aims to fix that too!)
